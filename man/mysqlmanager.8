\fBmysqlmanager\fR
is the MySQL Instance Manager (IM)\&. This program monitors and manages MySQL Database Server instances\&. MySQL Instance Manager is available for Unix\-like operating systems, and also on Windows as of MySQL 5\&.0\&.13\&. It runs as a daemon that listens on a TCP/IP port\&. On Unix, it also listens on a Unix socket file\&.
.PP
MySQL Instance Manager is included in MySQL distributions from version 5\&.0\&.3, and can be used in place of the
mysqld_safe
script to start and stop one or more instances of MySQL Server\&. Because Instance Manager can manage multiple server instances, it can also be used in place of the
\fBmysqld_multi\fR
script\&. Instance Manager offers these capabilities:

The MySQL Instance Manager supports a number of command options\&. For a brief listing, invoke
\fBmysqlmanager\fR
with the
\fB\-\-help\fR
option\&. Options may be given on the command line or in the Instance Manager configuration file\&. On Windows, the standard configuration file is
my\&.ini
in the directory where Instance Manager is installed\&. On Unix, the standard file is
/etc/my\&.cnf\&. To specify a different configuration file, start Instance Manager with the
\fB\-\-defaults\-file\fR
option\&.

\fBmysqlmanager\fR

.\" mysqlmanager: monitoring-interval option

\fB\-\-monitoring\-interval=\fR\fB\fIseconds\fR\fR
.sp
The interval in seconds for monitoring server instances\&. The default value is 20 seconds\&. Instance Manager tries to connect to each monitored (guarded) instance using the nonexisting
MySQL_Instance_Manager
user account to check whether it is available/not hanging\&. If the result of the connection attempt indicates that the instance is unavailable, Instance Manager performs several attempts to restart the instance\&.
.sp
Normally, the
MySQL_Instance_Manager
account does not exist, so the connection attempts by Instance Manager cause the monitored instance to produce messages in its general query log similar to the following:

This section discusses how Instance Manager starts server instances when it starts\&. However, before you start Instance Manager, you should set up a password file for it\&.

the section called \(lqINSTANCE MANAGER USER AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT\(rq\&.

On Unix, the
\fBmysqld\fR
MySQL database server normally is started with the
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
script, which usually resides in the
/etc/init\&.d/
directory\&. In MySQL 5\&.0\&.3, this script invokes
\fBmysqlmanager\fR
(the MySQL Instance Manager binary) to start MySQL\&. (In prior versions of MySQL the
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
script is used for this purpose\&.) Starting from MySQL 5\&.0\&.4, the behavior of the startup script was changed again to incorporate both setup schemes\&. In version 5\&.0\&.4, the startup script uses the old scheme (invoking
\fBmysqld_safe\fR) by default, but one can set the
use_mysqld_safe
variable in the script to
0
(zero) to use the MySQL Instance Manager to start a server\&.
.PP
Starting with MySQL 5\&.0\&.19, you can use Instance Manager if you modify the

configuration file by adding
use\-manager

When Instance Manager starts, it reads its configuration file if it exists to find server instance sections and prepare a list of instances\&. Instance sections have names of the form
[mysqld]
or
[mysqld\fIN\fR], where
\fIN\fR
is an unsigned integer (for example,
[mysqld1],
[mysqld2], and so forth)\&.
.PP
After preparing the list of instances, Instance Manager starts the guarded instances in the list\&. If there are no instances, Instance Manager creates an instance named
mysqld
and attempts to start it with default (compiled\-in) configuration values\&. This means that the Instance Manager cannot find the
\fBmysqld\fR
program if it is not installed in the default location\&. (Section\ \&2.7, \(lqInstallation Layouts\(rq, describes default locations for components of MySQL distributions\&.) If you have installed the MySQL server in a nonstandard location, you should create the Instance Manager configuration file\&.
.PP
Instance Manager also stops all guarded server instances when it shuts down\&.
.PP
The permissible options for
[mysqld\fIN\fR]
server instance sections are described in
the section called \(lqMYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES\(rq\&. In these sections, you can use a special
\fBmysqld\-path=\fR\fB\fIpath\-to\-mysqld\-binary\fR\fR
option that is recognized only by Instance Manager\&. Use this option to let Instance Manager know where the
\fBmysqld\fR
binary resides\&. If there are multiple instances, it may also be necessary to set other options such as
\fBdatadir\fR
and
\fBport\fR, to ensure that each instance has a different data directory and TCP/IP port number\&.
Section\ \&5.6, \(lqRunning Multiple MySQL Instances on One Machine\(rq, discusses the configuration values that must differ for each instance when you run multiple instance on the same machine\&.

To monitor the status of each guarded server instance, the MySQL Instance Manager attempts to connect to the instance at regular intervals using the
MySQL_Instance_Manager@localhost
user account with a password of
check_connection\&.

You are
\fInot\fR
required to create this account for MySQL Server; in fact, it is expected that it will not exist\&. Instance Manager can tell that a server is operational if the server accepts the connection attempt but refuses access for the account by returning a login error\&. However, these failed connection attempts are logged by the server to its general query log (see
Section\ \&5.2.2, \(lqThe General Query Log\(rq)\&.

Instance Manager also attempts a connection to nonguarded server instances when you use the
SHOW INSTANCES

SHOW INSTANCE STATUS
