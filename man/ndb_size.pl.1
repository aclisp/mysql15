.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a Perl script that can be used to estimate the amount of space that would be required by a MySQL database if it were converted to use the
NDBCLUSTER
storage engine\&. Unlike the other utilities discussed in this section, it does not require access to a MySQL Cluster (in fact, there is no reason for it to do so)\&. However, it does need to access the MySQL server on which the database to be tested resides\&.
.PP
\fBRequirements\fR:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A running MySQL server\&. The server instance does not have to provide support for MySQL Cluster\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A working installation of Perl\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The
DBI
and
HTML::Template
modules, both of which can be obtained from CPAN if they are not already part of your Perl installation\&. (Many Linux and other operating system distributions provide their own packages for one or both of these libraries\&.)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The
ndb_size\&.tmpl
template file, which you should be able to find in the
share/mysql
directory of your MySQL installation\&. This file should be copied or moved into the same directory as
ndb_size\&.pl\(emif it is not there already\(embefore running the script\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A MySQL user account having the necessary privileges\&. If you do not wish to use an existing account, then creating one using
GRANT USAGE ON \fIdb_name\fR\&.*\(emwhere
\fIdb_name\fR
is the name of the database to be examined\(emis sufficient for this purpose\&.
.RE
.PP
ndb_size\&.pl
and
ndb_size\&.tmpl
can also be found in the MySQL sources in
storage/ndb/tools\&. If these files are not present in your MySQL installation, you can obtain them from the
\m[blue]\fBMySQL Forge project page\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
\fBUsage\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
perl ndb_size\&.pl \fIdb_name\fR \fIhostname\fR \fIusername\fR \fIpassword\fR > \fIfile_name\fR\&.html
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The command shown connects to the MySQL server at
\fIhostname\fR
using the account of the user
\fIusername\fR
having the password
\fIpassword\fR, analyzes all of the tables in database
\fIdb_name\fR, and generates a report in HTML format which is directed to the file
\fIfile_name\fR\&.html\&. (Without the redirection, the output is sent to
stdout\&.) This figure shows a portion of the generated
ndb_size\&.html
output file, as viewed in a Web browser:
.sp
.RS 4
[IMAGE]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
Partial sample output from

Minimum values for the
